# blogyaml

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)


The goal of `blogyaml` is to help batch editing tags of Markdown-based blog posts. The initial motivation is rOpenSci website. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/blogyaml")
```
## How and why use this app

Here is how to launch the app.

``` r
blogyaml::edit_tags()
```

The workflow shoud ideally be:

* Have a local copy/clone of the website, and even work in a branch.

* Update tags (adding tags to posts, creating new tags) by using the app. 

* Have a look at changes in a git editor before committing/pushing/merging them.

This sounds in my opinion more appealing than opening each post on its own, because one gets to see all posts at once. My goal is to make adding tags to posts as user-friendly as adding topics to GitHub repositories.

## What this app shouldn't be used for

Standardization of tags (e.g. making all tags lowercase, or transforming all occurrences of "Community" into "community") doesn't need to happen manually via this app. It can be scripted using [`blogdown:::modify_yaml`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/from-jekyll.html) or similar helpers, cf [this example](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/issues/197#issuecomment-394264824).

## Note

The package uses a copy-pasted [internal `blogdown` function](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/blob/ad8be3ffb5ec8576a008375d8da6ec76ab01a902/R/utils.R#L465) hence the licence being GPL-3 like `blogdown`.
